# READ ME - Babl

## What are we doing?
Welcome to Babl! We've decided to build a brand new language-guessing game for the internet! Inspired by Wordle and Neardle, we've brought a brand new take to daily word puzzles. 

## How to play
Every day, a new phrase in a foreign language will appear on Babl. You have to guess what language the phrase is written in (it doesn't matter what the phrase actually says). If your guess is right, you'll win! If your guess is wrong, we'll tell you how close you got. You only get 6 tries. Good luck!

## Build status

## What we're using
