    Let's take a minute to talk about language families. When you're playing Babl and you guess an incorrect language, you're returned a percentage of linguistic similarity between the answer and your response. Much of this proximity is calculated using <b>language families</b>, which make up a big part of linguistics. If you're looking at European languages, check out this really awesome map:

  Note the Finno-Uralic family- it includes Finnish, Hungarian, Estonian, and some other languages. They're all linguistically isolated from the rest of Europe (some others, like Basque and Greek, are isolated for other reasons. They're not Finno-Uralic). If you guess Danish but recieve a low percentage, that doesn't rule out Finnish! Geography doesn't always translate into similarity. Moving east, here's a map of Asia's linguistic breakdown:

  This provides a general zoning overview of Asian languages- they are mostly geographic. Notice the isolation of Mongolian (tough to guess) and Japan. Additionally, look at the red swath that spans from India to Iran. This area is Indo-European, 
closely related to most of the languages in Europe! Yes, Persian and Hindi might actually return relatively high percentages compared to Russian or Italian. This is because Latin, Sanskrit, and other dead languages all descended from a common ancestor. This little-known connection can give you a strong edge in Babl.

  Remember that many Asian languages don't use the Latin alphabet (that's the one English uses). When they arrive at Babl, they are "romanized", or rewritten phonetically in the Latin alphabet. However, different languages have different romanization systems to spell out complicated sound systems that Eastern languages don't share with Western ones. In some Asian languages
